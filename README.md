# Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project involves building a logistic regression model using Python and scikit-learn in a Jupyter notebook environment to predict whether breast cancer is malignant or benign based on specific measurements from the breast cancer dataset.

## Project Highlights
- **Data:** Breast cancer dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data?resource=download#
- **Model:** Logistic Regression
- **Libraries:** Python, scikit-learn

## Features
- **Accurate Predictions:** The logistic regression model is trained to accurately classify whether breast cancer is malignant or benign.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** The project was developed and documented in a Jupyter notebook, making it easy to understand and reproduce the results.

## Future Work
- **Backend Integration:** Consider integrating the model with a Flask server for user interaction.
- **Web Interface:** Develop a user-friendly web interface for data input and prediction retrieval.
